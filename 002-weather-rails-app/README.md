The idea was to use data from a weather API to provide real-time weather information. The main purpose was to learn how to create an app with React as front-end framework and Rails as back-end framework...

However, the configuration is not that straigthforward. Tried to configure the app with Rails but had performance issues. Therefore, stopped. 

You still can find an app that works in folder 004!
