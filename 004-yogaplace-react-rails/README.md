*YOGA PLACE WEBSITE* 

This website is built with Ruby on Rails and API endpoints as backend, and the frontend utilizes React with the Vite framework and Framer Motion library for smooth animations.

Key features: 

1 - **Yoga Lessons Overview**: View detailed information about yoga lessons;

2 - **Agenda**: Check the schedule for upcoming yoga classes (date and location);

3 - **User management**: either as instructor or student, the dashboard will change accordingly.

4 - **Booking management**: the user can book classes which will be displayed on its personal page. 

Work in progress: booking validation system for instructor + implementing more Framer Motion features.
